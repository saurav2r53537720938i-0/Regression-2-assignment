    "Adjusted R squared is a modified version of R squared that adjusts for the number of predictor in the model it penalize the addtion of unnecessary predictors that do not improve the model explantory power.Adjusted R squared typically provides a more conservative estimate of the model goodness of fit compared to the regular R shaped it tends to be lower when addtional predictor are included in the model especially if those predictors do not substantially iimprove the model with difrrent number of predictor and slecting the most parsimonus model that adequately explains the variablity in the data."
